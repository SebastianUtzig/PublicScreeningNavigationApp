PublicScreeningNavigation.App

Due to some trouble with Android Studio we recommend to use exactly the same environment and SDK versions:

Android Studio (Beta) 0.8.0

Android SDK Build-tools 19.1
Google Play services
Google Repository

To set up the server one can import the “public_screening_db.sql” file for the database structure and some example locations. The server itself needs to be available under “[ServerIP]/PublicScreeningNavigation/[ScriptName]”. This directory should point into our “php” folder, where also the images will be stored.

Unfortunately there was no time left to develop landscape modes for the phone. Please show understanding and turn it off.
